            <p>I'm Julia, an apsiring software engineer. Recent bootcamp graduate and proud self-learner prior to that.</p>
            <p>How much personal info to put here? Technology has always interested me, particularly regarding the countless ways in which it's now shaping our day to day lives. In response to our ever-increasingly technological world, I found myself longing to contribute to it in a meaningful way. When I realized that being a software engineer was possible for someone like me, and not just a career for the "shy but brilliant hacker in his mom's basement" archetype, my love affair with coding was set in motion. </p>
            <p>My interest in working in technology, particularly software, stems from my interest in bettering the lives of my fellow humans. Software is wildly entrenched in our day to day lives-- in some ways that benefit everyone, and in some ways that are ethically murky at best. So why shouldn't I set out to use technology as a way to create beauty and foster inspiration and imagination? </p>

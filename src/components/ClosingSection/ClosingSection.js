            <p>I hope I've portrayed my enthusiasm about the opportunity to bring my skills to the team and challenge myself in a world-class engineering environment. My love for continuous learning, technical knowledge, and my mission to live by our shared values of inspiration and positive action convince me I am ready to meaningfully contribute as a Pinterest Apprentice.</p>
            <p style={{fontWeight: 'bold'}}> I'm excited about the possibility of contributing to the happiest corner of the internet and bringing imagination to people's lives.</p>
            <p>Thank you so much, and feel free to reach me at juliabreeden1018@gmail.com.</p>
